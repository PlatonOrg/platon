 * ActivityMemberView represents a database view that combines activity users
 * and course users. This view is built using two Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
 * - activity_users: Selects users who are specifically linked to an activity
 * - fallback_course_users: Selects users who are linked to a course, used as a fallback
 *
 * The view combines the results of both CTEs using a UNION ALL statement, prioritizing
 * the activity users and falling back to the course users if there are no activity users.
