    Serializes a dictionary object to JSON, excluding certain types.

            Defaults to True.

    Returns:
        str: The JSON representation of the dictionary object.

    Notes:
        - Certain types, such as None and specific custom classes, are excluded from the serialization process.
          Custom classes that are subclasses of types.ModuleType or types.FunctionType are excluded by default.
          The purpose of this exclusion is to avoid potential serialization issues or undesired side effects.
          If 'keep_classes' is set to False, the excluded custom class objects will be removed from the input
          dictionary before serialization.
        - The resulting JSON string is generated using the jsonpickle library, which supports serializing complex
          Python objects, including custom classes and instances.

    Example:
        d = {
            'form': '{{input}}',
            'a': 10,
            'b': 20,

    """
    Main function to execute the script.

    Reads the script code from a file, executes it with provided variables, and serializes the resulting variables
    to a JSON file.

    The script code is read from the file "script.py", and the variables to be passed to the script are read from
    the file "variables.json". The script is executed within a modified namespace, where additional objects and
    classes (Object, component, StopExec) are available.

    The resulting variables after executing the script are serialized using the 'jsonify' function and written to
    an output file named "output.json".

    The function uses the jsonpickle library to handle the serialization of complex Python objects, ensuring
    compatibility with custom classes and instances.

    Note:
        - It is assumed that the script file ("script.py") and the variables file ("variables.json") exist in
          the same directory as this script.

    Example:
        Assuming the following files exist:
        - script.py: Contains the code to be executed.
        - variables.json: Contains the variables to be passed to the script.

        The script can be executed by running:
        $ python3 runner.py

        This will execute the script code, serialize the resulting variables, and save them in "output.json".
